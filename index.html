    <p class="paragraph_style">This project introduces an advanced technique for improving the quality of low-light images, effectively mitigating issues associated with underexposed or dimly lit photographs. By leveraging lightweight convolutional neural networks (CNNs), this approach significantly improves image quality without requiring reference images. Instead, it makes use of existing datasets from previous works. The results underscore the efficiency of the lightweight network, which contains substantially fewer parameters, making it ideal for real-time applications. This project highlights my expertise in deep learning for image enhancement and its potential for real-world scenarios.
