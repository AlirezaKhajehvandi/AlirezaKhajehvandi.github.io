            This project introduces an advanced technique for improving the
            quality of low-light images, effectively mitigating issues
            associated with underexposed or dimly lit photographs. By leveraging
            lightweight convolutional neural networks (CNNs), this approach
            significantly improves image quality without requiring reference
            images. Instead, it makes use of existing datasets from previous
            works. The results underscore the efficiency of the lightweight
            network, which contains substantially fewer parameters, making it
            ideal for real-time applications. This project highlights my
            expertise in deep learning for image enhancement and its potential

            I've meticulously developed a LabVIEW software tailored exclusively
            for testing vacuum cleaners and precisely measuring their suction
            power, which includes airflow and electrical parameters. This
            software seamlessly communicates with a custom-designed board via
            serial and RS232 protocols, enabling it to collect parameters such
            as temperature, airflow, airflow rate, and electrical data. Through
            a command sent to an electrical valve located within the vacuum
            cleaner's air path, the software effectively controls airflow to
            assess the vacuum cleaner's suction power. Data collection occurs at
            various points, determined by airflow rate measurements, and various
            calculated parameters are derived as per the testing standards.
            These calculations include the measurement of the vacuum cleaner's
            power consumption, suction power, input power, and output power. The
            software provides comprehensive capabilities for real-time data
            display, storage, automatic control, and data acquisition during the
            testing process, ensuring precision and efficiency in conducting
            vacuum cleaner testing procedures.

            and a battery for power supply. When the slave board moves away from
            the master board, the buzzer on the master board activates, and the
            character display indicates the distance between them. This distance
            estimation is achieved through signal strength estimation
            transmitted via Bluetooth modules. A weaker signal suggests that the
            boards have moved apart, while a stronger signal indicates their
            proximity.
